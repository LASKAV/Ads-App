# Mobile Technical Challenge

This is a SwiftUI mobile application developed as a technical challenge. The project includes:

- Fetching and displaying a list of advertisements from a remote server.
- Viewing detailed information for each advertisement in a card format.
- Managing favorite advertisements with persistent storage.
- Modern architecture with clear separation of concerns:
  - **Core**: Networking, storage, and utilities.
  - **Features**: Business logic and UI for advertisements.
  - **ViewModels** and **Views** for each screen.
